# Island-Wraps-Kotlin-Repo-Spring-2021

Final Project Deliverable Document
=========================================
## Mobile Application Development II

### Project: Island Wraps App
 
**By:**
    **Alexis Rivaldo and Rachael Simmonds**
    
Product Definition Statement:
-----------------------------
This application will be a mobile “Point of Sales” system to allow customers to order food, contact the client/business, be alerted of recent or upcoming events, view a menu with prices, and be redirected to the clients social media page(s). This application will be for those who cannot wait for food inside a store or people who like food delivery services, but most importantly it is for the client, business owner of Island Wraps who need an application to reach a bigger audience of consumers. 
The difference from the competition is that I want the UI especially to be user friendly to customers. Many times other businesses will have an ordering application that is very confusing or doesn’t properly save a user's choices which will frustrate them to the point they will move on to another site. The business client's cuisine is exquisite and very appetizing so I would like the users to be indulged in the website in order to have a constant flow of business for our client.

Self evaluation and Documentation
================================= 
**Grade:**
----------
Personally, we would grade ourselves with a “C+” for the project. We had a solid proposal for the project but I think we fell short with time and implementation. We overlooked our time span we had left to work with this project and did not have the resources to implement core features of the app we wanted to implement. It also deserves a “C+” because we weren’t able to implement any extra features to it either due to our time constraints and other conflicting class projects. The pandemic took a toll on effort for the production of this project and also senioritis did not help either. Lack of enthusiasm to finish the project from team members also resulted in the incomplete product as well.

Described Activities/Fragments:
==========================
**Activities:**
------------
_MainActivity_: This is where the entire application will be loaded from and compiled to view on an emulated or mobile device.
_WrapActivity_: This would have been the activity for the wrap type menus, the other categories would have been implemented the same way.
Fragments:
_HomeFragment_: Allows the Home fragment to be displayed in the MainActivity.
_EventsFragment_: Allows the Events fragment to be displayed in the MainActivity.
_ContactFragment_: Allows the Contact fragment to be displayed in the MainActivity.
_MenuFragment_: Allows the Menu fragment to be displayed in the MainActivity.
_WrapFragment_: Allows the Wrap fragment to be displayed in the MainActivity.

**Layouts:**
-------------------
_Activity_main(land and portrait)_: Allows for the other fragments to be held on the main activity.
_Fragment_contact_: Has the layout/design for the contact page.
_Fragment_events_: Has the layout/design for the events page.
_Fragment_home_: Has the layout/design for the home page.
